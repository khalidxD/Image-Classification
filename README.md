## Project Aim :  
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that could classify images based on their content. To train the model, I first collected a large dataset of images by using the Fatkun extension in Google Chrome to scrape photos from Google Images. I then used OpenCV to clean the data and save the images in a cropped file, removing any irrelevant or redundant features.

Next, I experimented with various machine learning algorithms to find the best approach for image classification. After testing different models, including random forest and support vector machines, I found that logistic regression performed the best in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

To make the model accessible to others, I deployed it on a Flask server using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can upload an image to the server and receive a prediction about the image's content based on the model's classification results.
